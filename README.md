# Handling CSV files with Georgian (unicode) characters with R

## File encoding

CSV format is not a so basic text format. It exists several encodings supporting Georgian characters.  
First, it is important to identify in which encoding is your file.  For that, the best option is to use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download).  



Note: with MS Excel, when saving a xlsx format file with Georgian characters to CSV format, Georgian characters are replaced with '?' because it is not supported.  
For that, I advise to use [this Excel adding](https://jaimonmathew.wordpress.com/2011/08/23/excel_addin_to_work_with_unicode_csv/)
